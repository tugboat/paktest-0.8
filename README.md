This is an application to demonstrate Pakyow 0.8 features. Take a look at `app.rb` for the back-end code. Views are located in the `views` directory.

Running the app is easy:

  1. bundle install
  2. bundle exec pakyow server

Once running, open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 for more instruction.

Direct comments and questions to the mailing list (http://groups.google.com/group/pakyow). The Pakyow repo is located at https://github.com/metabahn/pakyow.

Happy coding!
