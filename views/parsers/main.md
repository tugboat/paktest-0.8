# Markdown!

This markdown *content view* mixes in with normal HTML views. It could just
as easily be HAML or some other template language. Scopes/Props can be added
to a non-HTML view and treated as a normal HTML view from the back-end (because
really it is an HTML view, just in another form).

  The markdown parser is defined on lines 153-155 of app.rb.
