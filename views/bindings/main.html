  Bindings have been changed to be more similar to the new routing engine. Just like
  routes can be thought of as mapping requests to logic, bindings map data to views.
  See examples on lines 157-178 of app.rb. A detailed explanation of bindings can
  be found <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/pakyow/Ap-Ui6p3qBc/discussion">here</a>
